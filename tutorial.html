            <h2>Tutorial: Checking if a coin is fair</h2>
            <p>Note: this tutorial is also available in
            the <a href="https://github.com/uiuc-arc/AxProf">GitHub
            repository</a> under
            the <a href="https://github.com/uiuc-arc/AxProf/tree/master/tutorial">tutorial</a>
            directory.</p>

            <p>This tutorial shows how to test a simple program with AxProf while also discussing other features available in AxProf.</p>

            <p>We will test a simple program that flips a specified number of coins.
            Each head is worth 1 and each tail is worth 0. It returns the sum as the output.
            We use AxProf to check that the program is using a fair coin.
            If so, the sum must be approximately equal to half of the number of coins.</p>
            <hr>
            First we import some required Python modules.
            You might need others for your test script.
            <pre><code>
                import random
                import sys
                import time
            </code></pre>
            <hr>
            The script must import AxProf.
            One way to achieve this is given below, but it assumes that AxProf is present in a particular path relative to the script.
            A better way would be to add the AxProf directory to the PATH environment variable of your system.
            <pre><code>
                sys.path.append('../AxProf')
                import AxProf
            </code></pre>
            <hr>
            <p>We specify a list of configurations that will be tested.
            For this program the only configuration parameter is the number of coins.
            The list of configurations is provided as a dictionary with the name of the configuration parameter as the key and the list of values for that parameter as the value.
            AxProf will test all combinations of configuration parameters.
            For example, if there are two parameters A and B where A can be 1 or 2 and B can be 3 or 4, AxProf will test a total of four configurations:</p>
            <code>[{A:1,B:3},{A:1,B:4},{A:2,B:3},{A:2,B:4}]</code>
            <pre><code>
                configList = {'coins':[10,100,1000]}
            </code></pre>
            <hr>
            The specification gives AxProf the information necessary to check that the program output is correct.
            The specification consists of a list of type declarations, followed by a TIME specification, SPACE specification, and ACCuracy specification.
            The specifications are optional, but they must be present in this order.
            Each type declaration or specification must be separated by a semicolon.
            The type of the Input and the Output must always be declared.
            The return type of any external functions used must also be declared.
            <pre><code>
                spec='''
                Input list of real;
                Output real;
                TIME coins;
                ACC Expectation over runs [Output] == coins/2
                '''
            </code></pre>

            <p>The above specification states that the input is a list
            of real numbers.  We will be generating an input for
            illustrative purposes, but we will not use it.  The output
            is a real number (the sum of the coin face values).  We
            specify that the time required should be proportional to
            the number of coins flipped.  AxProf will generate code to
            check that this is true.  Finally we specify that the
            expected value of the sum is half the number of coins.
            This expectation is over runs: an individual run might
            give a skewed value, but the average over multiple runs
            should be equal to <code>coins/2</code>.  AxProf
            recognizes that <code>coins</code> is a variable from the
            configuration list.  A SPACE specification is not given
            here.</p>

            This specification is very simple compared to some of the
            specifications for the other benchmarks.  See the
            benchmark script files for more examples of
            specifications, including probability specifications and
            specifications with universal quantification.
            <hr>

            <p>AxProf requires a function that it uses to generate
            parameters for the input generators.  This function takes
            the current configuration being tested and the input
            number, and returns a list of parameters to be passed to
            the input generator.  While we won't actually use the
            input for this program we will still invoke
            the <code>distinctIntegerGenerator</code> for illustrative
            purposes.  This generator takes 3 parameters: the number
            of integers to generate, the minimum integer value, and
            the maximum integer value.  The full list of generators is
            available in <code>AxProf/AxProfGenerators.py</code>. </p>
            <pre><code>
                def inputParams(config, inputNum):
                return [config['coins'], 0, 1000000]
            </code></pre>

            <p>This tells
            AxProf's <code>distinctIntegerGenerator</code> to generate
            distinct integers between 0 and 1000000.  The number of
            integers generated is equal to the number of coins.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>The runner is the interface to the implementation being
            tested.  It accepts the input file name and the current
            configuration being tested as parameters.  It then runs
            the implementation with the given input and configuration.
            In doing so it often invokes an external program using
            Python's subprocess module.  Finally it returns a
            dictionary to AxProf containing three things: the output
            of the program that will be used to test the
            implementation accuracy, the amount of time consumed, and
            the amount of memory used.  The task of time and memory
            usage measurement is left to the runner.</p>

            In this case we do not need to call an external program.
            We flip the coins, add their face values, measure the time
            taken to do so, and return the output.
            <pre><code>
                def runner(inputFileName, config):
                numCoins = config['coins']
                random.seed() # Seed RNG
                coinSum = 0
                startTime = time.time() # Start measuring time
                for i in range(numCoins):
                # Randomly pick 0 or 1 and add it to the sum
                # Adding more 0s or 1s will skew the results to simulate an unfair coin
                # AxProf should be able to detect this skew (unless it is small)
                coinSum += random.choice([0,1])
                endTime = time.time() # Stop measuring time
                # Prepare result; we don't measure memory but must specify it, so set it to 0
                result = {'acc': coinSum, 'time': (endTime-startTime), 'space': 0}
                return result
            </code></pre>
            <hr>
            Finally, we invoke AxProf's checkProperties function.
            It takes the following parameters:
            <ol>
              <li> The list of configurations to test.
              <li> The number of times the implementation should be run.
                Setting this to <code>None</code> will allow AxProf to choose the number of runs automatically based on the statistical test used.
              <li> The number of different inputs to test the implementation with.
              <li> The type of input generator to use.
              <li> The function used to give parameters to the input generator.
              <li> The runner i.e. the application interface.
            </ol>

            <p>Apart from this, it takes multiple optional parameters.
            Usually, only the specification needs to be provided.
            AxProf will generate all necessary code from the specification and use it to test the program.
            It is important to use <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> when invoking AxProf.
            We also measure the total time taken to use AxProf.</p>
            <pre><code>
                if __name__ == '__main__':
                startTime = time.time() # Start measuring time
                AxProf.checkProperties(configList, None, 1, AxProf.distinctIntegerGenerator,
                inputParams, runner, spec=spec)
                endTime = time.time() # Stop measuring time
                print('Total time required for checking:',endTime-startTime,'seconds.')
            </code></pre>
            <hr>

            <p>The complete script is available in
            the <a href="https://github.com/uiuc-arc/AxProf/tree/master/tutorial">tutorial</a>
            directory.  To run this script, run <code>python3
            tutorial.py</code> from the same directory.  First, AxProf
            prints the code generated from the spec.  This includes
            code to check accuracy, some utility code, code to write
            time data to a file, and fit a curve to the time data (in
            this case a linear function over the number of coins).
            Next, it prints the chosen number of runs (in this case
            200).  Finally it runs the implementation for each
            configuration.  If any errors are detected, it
            prints <code>Checker detected a possible error</code>.
            Otherwise it silently completes execution.  Lastly, it
            prints the optimal curve fit parameters and the R^2 metric
            of the fit.  The time usage data is also written to the
            cutputs directory that is created in this
            directory.</p>

            <p>Try editing the line above that
            invokes <code>random.choice</code> by adding more 0s or 1s
            to skew the results.  AxProf should be able to detect the
            skew (unless it is very mild)</p>
